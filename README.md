# ResourceHub

This is a small group project created by BevilMulor. The aim was to test my programming skillset and try to create a useful website for a particular community and I came up with *RESOURCE HUB*. This website is for the students currently attending Jamhuri Campus and struggle to find right source materials to study as the Intranet is not very user friendly.

## Requirements to run on your local machine
